# Kadenze 'Advanced Audio Plugin Development' Application

This is the official repository of the 'Advanced Audio Plugin Development' course on Kadenze.com. This is the exact project taught in the course lessons including some modernizations and updates to the JUCE framework (6.0.8).

This course was originally created a few years ago, and due to the nature of frameworks
updating, and videos not updating (unless we re-record all the material!), I've decided
to place this project on my personal Github.

Please reach out if you have any questions, happy coding!
